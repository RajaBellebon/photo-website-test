_Goal_: Being able to solve those problems

You will need to read https://www.pierre-giraud.com/python-apprendre-programmer-cours/introduction/

I suggest those chapters below first

**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 & 14**

(chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 will be when you are able to achieve those problems)

### Problem 2

Write a Python program to display the current date and time.

Helper: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html

### Problem 3

Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.

```
color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
```


### Problem 4

Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
Example :
```
3 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : True
-1 -> [1, 5, 8, 3] : False
```

Good Luck!
