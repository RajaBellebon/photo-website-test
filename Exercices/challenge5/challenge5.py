# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate and then generates them.
# Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions.
# Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
# (Hint: The Fibonacci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
# (Hint2: You can use `input` to ask a user to type the input)
# (Hint3: Think about the edge case, if the user enters 0 or 1
# (Hint4: Use conditionals `if, elif..` and you would need to understand looping for array and list
